::: {.panel style="text-align: justify;"}
I'm a Scientist at [NeuroAge Therapeutics](https://www.neuroagetx.com/home), where I help to develop therapies that reverse brain aging and treat age-related brain diseases.

Before, I was a Biology of Aging PhD Student in the Campisi Lab at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. There, I worked on cellular senescence, an established hallmark of aging. I developed a [high-throughput method to measure senescence burden](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-024-01167-3), and identified [sub-populations of senescent cells with different sensitivity to senolytic treatment](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.22.600200).

Iâ€™m deeply interested in aging/longevity biotech. My goal within the next few years is to directly contribute to the R&D and operations that will add healthy years to everyone's life by bringing a longevity drug to the market.
