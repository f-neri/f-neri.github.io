::: {.panel style="text-align: justify;"}
I’m a researcher deeply interested in aging/longevity biotech. My goal is to directly contribute to the R&D and operations that will add healthy years to everyone's life by bringing longevity drugs to the market.

I was the Director of Research & Operations at the San Francisco-based startup [NeuroAge Therapeutics](https://www.neuroagetx.com/home), where I led early target validation efforts and then oversaw operations related to the consumer-facing NeuroAge Test.

Before that, I completed my PhD in Biology of Aging in the Campisi Lab at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. There, I worked on cellular senescence, an established hallmark of aging. I developed a [high-throughput method to measure senescence burden](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-024-01167-3) and identified [sub-populations of senescent cells with different sensitivity to senolytic treatment](https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.206299).
