## Experience

**2024 - 2026**

##### **Director of Research & Operations** \| NeuroAge Therapeutics \| San Francisco, CA

-   First employee. Set up NeuroAge's laboratory infrastructure, including procurement of equipment, negotiating with vendors, and securing permits to ensure compliance with health and safety regulations.
-   Led target validation efforts, generating preliminary data that supported the submission of grant applications. This included the development of plate-based assays to assess drug response using live-cell imaging.
-   Oversaw the clinical operations of the NeuroAge Test. Responsibilities included contributing to the cloud-based analysis pipeline for transcriptome and whole-genome sequencing data, the development of a custom CRM system, and coordination with partner services (MRI centers, phlebotomy services, and sequencing companies).

**2021 - 2024**

##### **Biology of Aging PhD Student** \| Campisi Lab \| Buck Institute & University of Southern California \| Novato, CA

-   Led multiple collaborative projects with other Buck and external research groups, which resulted in 2 first-author publications. These projects entailed developing a high-throughput imaging method to measure senescence burden and using high-content image analysis to identify sub-populations of senescent cells with different sensitivity to senolytic treatment.
-   Supported the organization and coordination of multiple international aging conferences, including managing all volunteer operations for the Seno-Therapeutic Summit 2023 and assisting with the Longevity Summit 2022, 2023, and 2024.

**2019 – 2021**

##### **Research Associate** \| Campisi Lab \| Buck Institute \| Novato, CA

-   Created a step-by-step workflow to generate and analyze senescent-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) samples, leading to a first-author publication. This involved collecting several protocols developed by colleagues and carefully distilling them into a generalized and clear workflow.

-   Aided multiple projects led by other lab members, which resulted in 2 publications in peer-reviewed journals. My role involved preparing senescent samples using primary human cell strains.

-   Performed lab managing duties, including setting up centralized laboratory resources to share tested protocols and reagents among lab members, general maintenance of lab equipment, and purchasing new instruments.

**March 2019 – September 2019**

##### **Master’s Degree Intern** \| Campisi Lab \| Buck Institute \| Novato, CA

-   Contributed to characterizing the heterogeneity of the senescent-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) from cell culture senescence models, which resulted in a published manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal. Specifically, I prepared SASP samples, which involved culturing primary human cell strains, inducing cellular senescence in such cell culture models, and validating senescence induction via multiple molecular biology assays (e.g. immunocytochemistry, RT-qPCR, western blotting).

**February 2017 – April 2017**

##### **Bachelor’s Degree Intern** \| Perini Lab \| University of Bologna \| Bologna, Italy

-   Established MYCN potential role in the upregulation of plasma membrane transporters SLC7A1 and SLC7A2 as measured by a luciferase assay in a MYCN-inducible neuroblastoma cell line. This involved the cloning of SLC7A1 and SLC7A2 promoter regions into a luciferase reporter plasmid, their transfection into the neuroblastoma cell line, and carrying out luciferase assays.
