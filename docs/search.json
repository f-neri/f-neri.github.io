    "text": "I’m a Biology of Aging PhD Student in the Campisi Lab at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging.\nDuring my PhD, I’ve been using high-content imaging and a bit of R to study cellular senescence, an established hallmark of aging. I developed a high-throughput workflow to measure senescence burden, and identified sub-populations of senescent cells with different sensitivity to senolytics (unpublished).\nBefore moving to the US, I got my Bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology and then my Master’s degree in Pharmaceutical Biotechnology at the University of Bologna in Italy - my home country. I also lived in Ireland for a year during high school - which is where I learned English - and spent a summer waiting tables in London.\nI’m deeply interested in aging/longevity biotech. Developing therapeutics that can extend everyone’s healthy years of life is possibly one the most important and hard problems to tackle."
