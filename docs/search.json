    "text": "Experience\n2024 - 2026\n\nDirector of Research & Operations | NeuroAge Therapeutics | San Francisco, CA\n\nFirst employee. Set up NeuroAge’s laboratory infrastructure, including procurement of equipment, negotiating with vendors, and securing permits to ensure compliance with health and safety regulations.\nLed target validation efforts, generating preliminary data that supported the submission of grant applications. This included the development of plate-based assays to assess drug response using live-cell imaging.\nOversaw the clinical operations of the NeuroAge Test. Responsibilities included contributing to the cloud-based analysis pipeline for transcriptome and whole-genome sequencing data, the development of a custom CRM system, and coordination with partner services (MRI centers, phlebotomy services, and sequencing companies).\n\n2021 - 2024\n\n\nBiology of Aging PhD Student | Campisi Lab | Buck Institute & University of Southern California | Novato, CA\n\nLed multiple collaborative projects with other Buck and external research groups, which resulted in 2 first-author publications. These projects entailed developing a high-throughput imaging method to measure senescence burden and using high-content image analysis to identify sub-populations of senescent cells with different sensitivity to senolytic treatment.\nSupported the organization and coordination of multiple international aging conferences, including managing all volunteer operations for the Seno-Therapeutic Summit 2023 and assisting with the Longevity Summit 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\n2019 – 2021\n\n\nResearch Associate | Campisi Lab | Buck Institute | Novato, CA\n\nCreated a step-by-step workflow to generate and analyze senescent-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) samples, leading to a first-author publication. This involved collecting several protocols developed by colleagues and carefully distilling them into a generalized and clear workflow.\nAided multiple projects led by other lab members, which resulted in 2 publications in peer-reviewed journals. My role involved preparing senescent samples using primary human cell strains.\nPerformed lab managing duties, including setting up centralized laboratory resources to share tested protocols and reagents among lab members, general maintenance of lab equipment, and purchasing new instruments.\n\nMarch 2019 – September 2019\n\n\nMaster’s Degree Intern | Campisi Lab | Buck Institute | Novato, CA\n\nContributed to characterizing the heterogeneity of the senescent-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) from cell culture senescence models, which resulted in a published manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal. Specifically, I prepared SASP samples, which involved culturing primary human cell strains, inducing cellular senescence in such cell culture models, and validating senescence induction via multiple molecular biology assays (e.g. immunocytochemistry, RT-qPCR, western blotting).\n\nFebruary 2017 – April 2017\n\n\nBachelor’s Degree Intern | Perini Lab | University of Bologna | Bologna, Italy\n\nEstablished MYCN potential role in the upregulation of plasma membrane transporters SLC7A1 and SLC7A2 as measured by a luciferase assay in a MYCN-inducible neuroblastoma cell line. This involved the cloning of SLC7A1 and SLC7A2 promoter regions into a luciferase reporter plasmid, their transfection into the neuroblastoma cell line, and carrying out luciferase assays."

    "text": "I’m a researcher deeply interested in aging/longevity biotech. My goal is to directly contribute to the R&D and operations that will add healthy years to everyone’s life by bringing longevity drugs to the market.\nI was the Director of Research & Operations at the San Francisco-based startup NeuroAge Therapeutics, where I led early target validation efforts and then oversaw operations related to the consumer-facing NeuroAge Test.\nBefore that, I completed my PhD in Biology of Aging in the Campisi Lab at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. There, I worked on cellular senescence, an established hallmark of aging. I developed a high-throughput method to measure senescence burden and identified sub-populations of senescent cells with different sensitivity to senolytic treatment."
