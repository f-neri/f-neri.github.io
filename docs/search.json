    "text": "I’m a Biology of Aging PhD Candidate in the Campisi Lab at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging.\nDuring my PhD, I worked on cellular senescence, an established hallmark of aging. I developed a high-throughput method to measure senescence burden, and identified sub-populations of senescent cells with different sensitivity to senolytic treatment (to be published soon!).\nI’m deeply interested in aging/longevity biotech. My goal within the next 10 years is to directly contribute to the R&D and operations that will add healthy years to everyone’s life by bringing a longevity drug to the market."
